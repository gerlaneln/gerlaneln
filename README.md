### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with 4+ years of experience turning ideas into solid, scalable web solutions â€” both on the front-end and back-end.

Currently, I'm working as a Junior Systems Analyst at the Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (UFPR), where I help build and maintain web systems that support public exams and selection processes. My main stack includes **Java with Spring Boot**, **Angular (v13 & v17)**, and **Oracle databases**, but I also have experience with **React, React Native**, **MongoDB**, and **MySQL**.

On the back-end side, I work a lot with RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, data modeling, PL/SQL scripts, and reporting tools. On the front-end, I build user-friendly interfaces using Angular, integrating with back-end services and focusing on performance and usability. I've also handled legacy systems built in Spring MVC.

Besides coding, I have a background in **graphic design** â€” I volunteered during the pandemic to help small businesses with branding and social media mentoring. It really sharpened my visual communication and UX awareness.

### ðŸ’» My Toolbox

- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3  
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Angular (v13 & v17), ReactJS, React Native  
- **Databases:** Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Tools & Extras:** Git, GitHub, Node.js, PL/SQL, Material UI, Bootstrap  
- **Design skills:** CorelDRAW, Canva

### ðŸŽ“ A bit about my background:

- Bachelorâ€™s in Information Systems â€“ Federal University of Acre (UFAC)  
- Postgrad in Marketing & Advertising â€“ University of Amazonas  
- Full Stack training by Gama Academy, Web Academy (UFAC + Instituto Eldorado + Motorola), and freeCodeCamp

### ðŸš€ What drives me:

I'm always up for a challenge â€” especially ones that push me to grow, learn new tech, and build meaningful, real-world applications. I'm especially into back-end architecture, API performance, and clean, maintainable code.

Letâ€™s connect and build something cool! ðŸ˜„
